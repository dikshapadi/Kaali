          Our story began when we were introduced to The Clothelines Project by The Durga India foundation that works with
          the MCA dept of our college. The inititaive seemed to click something; we realized how important the issue of abuse
          was, how many different types of abuse there was and how so many people were victimes of it. On researching a little
          more, we found out that women were facing a greater deal of abuse than men and how such a small fraction of them
          asked for help or were even aware of what they were going through was not normal. We also noticed many actions
          of abuse have been normalized as moments of intense passion-anger and even, love. As we looked more into this, the 
          thoughts to work on this became more concretized and the needs of a victim became more clear and Kaali was born.
<br>
<br>
          With this core thought in mind, our founders came up with the idea of Kaali. The main goal of Kaali is to educate
women about their rights and make them realize that they are too entitled to a safe,independent and dignified 
life of which they have full control. We also notices how many perpetrators did not know that their acts were in
fact actions of abuse. Along those lines we aim to conduct workshops for women, men and childern to undeerstand 
what abuse is and identify if someone is facing that. 
Kaali aims to make a safe space, one stop portal for women to access all sorts of support systems they need for 
help to no more be victims and get back on their feet to lead respectable and safe lives.
